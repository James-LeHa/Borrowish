# Feature Spec #1

Goal of this feature: Setup the repository with a basic outline of the client side app in Typescript. The skeleton app should be able to run with minimal work and should be converted to Typescript.

1. ~~Create the Github Repo~~
2. ~~Create initial implementation of the client/website~~
3. ~~Create the initial implementation of the server/node backend~~
4. Create an interaction between the two services with TDD
5. Setup an automated testing system to test each PR
6. Setup an automated deployment to deploy to netlify or a similar service and using Github actions.

With this...developers will be able to build upon this skeleton and have some of the basic code, tests and devops tools setup.
